"noticing her Oh, look! Look! Look!"

Did you find it?
"Okay, those are my sunglasses, you borrowed them from me."
To Rachel What are we going to do?!

"I know, I'm sorry, please forgive me. I don't know what to say"
Really? Even more humiliating than
"Hey, Ross! He lowers his newspaper and scowls at her I know you're still mad at me, but can I just talk to you for a second?"
I just really wanted to apologize again and and also show you something I think you'll find very exciting.
"Look, Ross, in this box are all the things I got from mugging that I thought were too special to sell or smoke. Ross looks at her in astonishment Anyway, I was looking through it and I found ""Science Boy"" She holds up some sheets of paper and hands them to Ross"
"I can't say, I just thought it was really good and maybe would be worth something some day."
"Yeah but you should know, I also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here."
"You're welcome. And thank you for ""Science Boy"". I learned a lot from him"
Why??
"Oh...you don't have to go, I have something that will fit you."
I want you to stay.
Why don't you turn them inside ou...
I'll miss you.
Great! Ok...I'll go get the tube top.
"Wow, Mike Hannigan...You sure know how to make a girl say ""Hell"
Yeah! Let's do it! Let's live together! They embrace and Mike kisses
"I've always wanted to live with a guy. ""Pick up your socks!"" ""Put"
"Hey you guys! Ok, we've got great news."
I know it's so exciting! You know I've never lived with a guy before.
"Okay, well you put down the toilet seat."
Uh huh...we're playing you two.
Monica slow down! Ok? I'm just excited to be living with him. You
I know! I guess I am! Oh my god! Load up the Volvo I want to be a
Yeah! You bet roomy!
"Oh please, these guys, we haven't even moved in yet and they have"
China patterns!!!!!
Oh! Alright. Well I think the reason people laugh is becuase it's
Oh no! No no! Not at all. We're just moving in right now. See where
What do you mean?
Oh. Wow.
Was it really that bad?
"Ok, well that's bad. But don't you think it might be different with"
But it's just...
Oh!
No! I definitely don't wanna get married. No I just wanted to make
Yeah I get that.
Hi
"Listen, I wanted to ask you something about marriage."
No...I really wanted to know how you feel about it.
Mike doesn't ever wanna get married.
Never.
"I want to, but I just want you to tell me that marriage isn't really"
That's not how you really feel is it?
Seriously? You divorceo?
It's ok that's how you feel.
I do love Mike.
Yeah I guess you're right. Yeah thanks. This helped. Thanks.
It's not cooler.
Better.
"Oh yeah you were helpful! Yeah, no, thanks you."
What do you mean?
They are awfully boxy...
Uh huh.
Just one last time erm... the marriage thing... there's no wiggle
Right. Except that I do want to get married.
Someday.
I haven't exactly had a normal life and I never really felt I was
"Because I just didn't know how much I wanted it. And I love you, and"
But I don't think I can! it was ok to move in when I didn't know what
Are you gonna change yours?
Me neither. I think I need to be with someone who wants what I want.
I don't want it to end either.
Yeah.
Hi.
"Breaking up sucks! Oh, I really miss Mike!"
"Oh God, I tried everything to make myself feel better. I even tried writing a song about it... but... I can't think of anything that rhymes with AARRGGHH!! pause Hey Monica, I really need your help getting through this..."
"Well no, when I get to the point where... you know... I'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about Mike... I'm gonna come to you."
"Ok. I mean I know I did the right thing. You know, Mike never wants to get married and I shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon I'm gonna miss him so much. I'm gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that."
"after a pause Unless... Maybe it's too crazy about this... Alright so... you know, there is no future... but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. You know what? Forget what I said."
That was a test and you just failed.
"God, I wish Mike were here."
"I gotta call him. Just to talk to him, there's no harm in that."
Here.
"Okay she takes a huge, clearly obsolete cellphone she keeps in a closet and gives it to Monica"
Yes.
"Yes, it reminds me of a simpler time."
You can't have it.
No tucks it in her pants
disbelievingly Oh yeah.
Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!
"You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after I've buzzed you into the building."
Those are my shoes.
"Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me, but I'm actually feeling a lot better. Yeah, I just kinda want to be alone right now."
I ordered Chinese food.
What are the chances? 1 billion Chinese people and they send Mike!?
"I'm sorry, I broke down...  I wanted to see him."
There is a speakerphone on the base unit...
Not if nothing happens. Why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?
Sit down.
"Thanks, you look good too."
So how's the piano playing going?
I've missed you too.
"I know, I want that too, but IS that going to make it too hard?"
What?
"Oh, I missed you so much! she kisses Mike"
Who is this?
Hey will you get me tickets too?
You don't wanna win the lottery?
"excitedHey you guys! Ok, you're not going to"
Oh can I? Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone.

"One, two, three!"
Get a room!
"Oooh, I like that, ""daddy"" in a sexy tone"
"still in sexy tone Oooh, is daddy getting angry? Is"

Uh! The psychic also said that I would be betrayed.
"Oh, you guys! We've got to keep all the tickets"
she takes the bowl from Rachel's hands and she
keeping on running and yelling OOOOOHHHHH! she
"If we are not doing it together, we're not doing it"
Don't come any closer!
"No, what's more important, your friends or money?"
"Hey Monica, what about your extra tickets?"
"Ok, good! pause You guys were so scared! There was"
What a beautiful night to be running around the
"So, what? Monica, we have the winning ticket! My"
As a matter of fact she said that's how I am going to
"Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do."
"Guys, the drawing is about to start!"
I'm still looking through mine...
"You guys, what was the Powerball number again?"
We won.
We won!
Don't tear it.
"I know that, but look, we've got the Powerball number,"

Hey!
"Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant she dons a top hat uh, huh wait! she raises a pair of spectacles to her eyes Right? I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man."
"Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault."
"Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back she puts the hat in a bag and she crushes it angrily on the floor with her foot."
My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?
Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?
"Yeah well, ""excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but peering through her spectacles I can't see it, I can't see it""!"
Well...it's not about quality.
"Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica."
"Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?"
"What are people having, the garlic Martini?"
singing Food here at 'Javu'..will kill you..the food here at 'Javu' ...will kill you..
"You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself."
Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you!
while Monica drags her in the restaurant Get your garlicpeelers off me!
"Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside? a few people raise their hands Ha!"
"Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?"
"Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? all raise their hands."
Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great! raises her hand
I'm sorry too... they hug
Yeah! As long as it's free! Food here is ridiculously overp...
"smiling, raising her hand Who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me?"
What is it?
"I know, I know, we can drive, we can vote, we can work, what more do these broads want?"
Hi!
"Oh, you're a paleonthologist, too! pause Oh, ok, now, what do you think of Ranion's new theory of species' variegation in segmented arthopods?"

"Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper?"
"Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know,"
"You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind, and funny..."
Ok well give her a chance to see all of that!
"Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!"

"I feel really strongly about this, Rachel. Please, don't use"
Promise?
Thank you. she tears up the gift certificate
Ok. Do we have to talk like that then they're not around? She
But that woman can't know I work
'Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that

Exactly!
"after a short pause I didn't even think about that! pause Aaargh, sexual politics!!"
"Ok, that'll be great!"

Good plan.
"Oh! I'm sorry Rachel, I don't have time for your childish games, ok? I still have to go find something incredible to wear so I can beat Mike at ""who's more over who""! at which she walks away"
Are you sure? Because I'm really dreading going to this party.
"Mike knows I'm coming, and if I don't show up he'll think it's because of him! And I don't want to lose face! That's a very serious thing in my culture."
"You got it! Ok. But not on the wine that you made, ok, because I just don't want to go back to the Emergency Room."
David?

"Oh, is that you?"
Hey!

"Well, personally I think it's great you're giving yourself a break."
"Sure. It's just as well... I mean, last year wasn't very good. I think she's losing her touch."
"Am I? Really? Am I? Well, why don't you cook Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! Well, think about it, think about it, you'll be trying to top than you did last year. You'd be in competition... with yourself."

sarcastic Oh... okay.
"Okay, oh, and Emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition."
"Well, I was thinking..."
Yeah!

"Uh, we were at the Spelling Bee!"
And it looks like she put makeup on her!
"You guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier!"
"Alright, what are we gonna say?"
"Oh, good, that's good, but you don't look like you were mugged!"
"We're just... we're trying to figure out an excuse. Hey! Ooh! How about this We can say that Monica told us 5 o'clock, not 4 o'clock. That way we're right on time! Others start to agree but she continues OR... or, we can plant PCP in the apartment and call the cops on her."
"Well, I'm not going in first. I bet that vein on Monica's forehead is popping like crazy."
"Oh, really? Does it beat water balloon? She places her hand over his ""fire"" and mimics a bursting water balloon, thus putting the fire out."
It's locked.
What are we gonna do? I'm starving.
Oh yeah!
"Well, I don't know if that's such a good idea. They clearly don't want to be with us."
So bad.

"Oh yeah? Well, let's see. she takes her mobile phone Ok, duck down. they both get down to hide themselves. Phoebe calls Chandler"

"Wha..? Again with the nature, what are you? Beavers?"

"Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head inside a turkey's ass!"
"Ok, you guys, I dont mean to make things worse, but umm, I dont want to live with Rachel anymore."
Youre just so mean to each other! And I dont want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!

I don't care. We're not paying you 300 dollars for this.
"Oh yeah, okay. I'm uptight. Yeah, that's why I don't want to watch a middle aged guy dance around in what I can only assume is a child halloween costume! turns to look at Monica and Rachel who look like they feel very sorry for the stripper"
"I'm sorry, did you say all man or old man?"
"You know, it's fine. We'll pay you."
"Or you could teach stripping. You know, share your gift, pass the torch."
